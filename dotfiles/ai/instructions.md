# Worktree Management

Use `wt` (worktrunk) for all worktree operations instead of raw `git worktree` commands:

- `wt switch --create <branch>` to create a new worktree/branch
- `wt switch <branch>` to switch to an existing worktree
- `wt list` to show worktrees and their status
- `wt merge` to squash, rebase, fast-forward merge, and clean up
- `wt remove` to remove a worktree
- `wt step commit` to commit with LLM-generated message
- `wt step copy-ignored` to copy gitignored files between worktrees

## Cockpit contexts (proart-only)

The workspace-per-stack flow (ws-createwt, per-ticket niri workspaces) is
RETIRED on proart. Everything lives on one `lovable` workspace — the
cockpit: three fixed kitty windows (agent, nvim, devenv) plus the work
browser, where each worktree is a *context* = one tab in each window.

When the user asks for a new worktree on proart, use
`~/.config/niri/scripts/cockpit-add <name>`. It creates the branch +
worktree via wt (`daphen/<name>` off fresh origin/main, at
`~/work/lovable.daphen-<name>`), opens one tab per cockpit window (claude
resumes the newest non-empty session for that worktree, devenv boots the
wt slice), registers the context for crash-restore, and switches to it.
No workspace is claimed and no windows spawn, so no confirmation needed —
but the cockpit windows must exist (`cockpit-open` is idempotent;
`cockpit-restore` rebuilds everything after a crash).

Naming: the context name IS the branch short-name and KEEPS the team
prefix (Linear auto-link needs the full ticket id). Given only a ticket
number ("add 2542 to the cockpit"), fetch the ticket via the Linear MCP
and derive a short kebab slug from its title. For EVERY-1234 about
"fix button overflow":
- context name / worktree: `every-1234-fix-button-overflow`
- git branch: `daphen/every-1234-fix-button-overflow`
- `main` is a special context: the primary checkout, runs `devenv deps`.

Switching: `cockpit-switch <name>` (users press Super+T). Closing: Ctrl+W
in the picker closes the tabs and keeps the dir; `wt remove daphen/<name>`
deletes it. The old ws-* scripts remain on disk but are unbound — don't
reach for them unless the user explicitly asks.

## Lovable-on-Lovable sandboxes (proart-only)

For tasks that should run in a REMOTE Lovable sandbox instead of locally,
the flow is two steps because **project creation is now Castle-gated**
(requires a browser-minted `X-Castle-Request-Token` that CLI scripts
can't produce):

```
ws-newlol                              # opens lovable.dev in work browser
# in the browser: workspace → New Project → toggle LoL → submit
# copy the resulting URL
ws-createlovbox <name> <project-url>   # claims the sandbox + spawns the stack
```

`ws-createlovbox` itself has three modes for the second arg:

```
ws-createlovbox <name>                      # scratch sandbox, no project (mode 1)
ws-createlovbox <name> <project-url>        # existing Lovable project (mode 2)
ws-createlovbox <name> <claim-name>         # existing sandbox by claim (mode 3)
```

The previous `--prompt` mode is removed — it talked directly to
`api.lovable.dev`'s project-create, which is now blocked by Castle for
any non-browser caller. Trying it prints an error pointing at ws-newlol.

`<name>` is the workspace short name — NO `daphen-` prefix. That prefix
belongs to local branches/worktrees only; ws-createlovbox prepends
`lovable-` itself. For Linear ticket EVERY-1186 about "Support private
npm registries", the name is `1186-private-npm-registries`, the
workspace becomes `lovable-1186-private-npm-registries`. Passing
`daphen-1186-...` as the second arg makes lovssh try to resolve it as
a claim/UUID and fail.

For an internal monorepo task (just need a sandbox to ship feature
work, no Lovable demo project), use mode 1 — scratch sandbox, skip
ws-newlol entirely.

Spawns a stack on a `lovable-<name>` workspace (same naming pattern as
ws-createwt so pickers show them together): lovssh→claude in
~/lovable, lovssh→nvim in ~/lovable, plus a work-profile browser if a
project URL is associated. No local worktree, no local devenv — the
sandbox owns both; edits happen remotely via SSH.

For reviewing a GitHub PR locally (different again — fetches the PR,
checks out on a `review/pr-<num>` branch, spawns the standard
4-window devenv stack), use `ws-createreview <pr-url-or-number>`.

Pick which script based on cues:

- Want a NEW LoL project, no URL yet → ws-newlol (browser only)
- LoL / "lovbox" / sandbox / project URL or claim given →
  `cockpit-add-lovbox <name> [url-or-claim]` — the sandbox becomes a
  REMOTE cockpit context (tabs land in it via lovssh; type claude/nvim
  after landing). ws-createlovbox's workspace-spawning half is retired;
  its provisioning survives via --provision-only underneath.
- New worktree / Linear ticket / local feature work → cockpit-add
- Reviewing someone else's PR → ws-createreview
- Fire-and-forget spec→PR against the monorepo, no local setup →
  `lovc exec --lol` (production-agent CLI; see the vault reference
  `references/lovc-cli.md` — not yet installed locally as of 2026-07-26)

Confirm before invoking either: ws-createlovbox claims a paid sandbox,
ws-createreview fetches+branches off main. ws-newlol just opens a
browser — no confirmation needed.

**Never preemptively run `ws-close-stack` to "clean up" before creating
a new workspace.** It closes every window on the focused workspace; if
that workspace happens to be `lovable-main` (the user's persistent
primary), it wipes their browser, Slack, music etc. ws-close-stack
itself now refuses to operate on `lovable-main`, but other reserved
workspaces could exist. Only invoke when the user explicitly asks for
teardown of a specific worktree's stack.

# Cross-environment prompts

When composing a prompt that will be sent to a remote agent (LoL project
chat in the lovable.dev web UI, a separate Claude session, an agent
inside a lovbox SSH session, etc.), the receiving agent has no access to
my filesystem, env vars, or shell state. References to local paths like
`~/notes/foo.md` or `~/work/lovable/...` will dead-end on their side.

Inline the relevant content directly in the prompt instead of pointing to
local paths. Same goes for env vars, niri workspace state, browser context.
If a referenced file is too large to inline, mention that explicitly and ask
the user whether to scp it across or summarize.

# Commits

Never mention Claude, Claude Code, or Anthropic in commit messages. Do not add Co-Authored-By lines referencing Claude.

# Comments

Default to writing **no comments**. Only add one when the WHY is non-obvious:
a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific bug, or
behavior that would surprise a reader. If removing the comment wouldn't
confuse a future reader, don't write it.

Specifically don't write:
- Comments that restate what well-named code does ("// Set the timeout to 30s")
- Section dividers ("// --- Helpers ---")
- Doc comments that just restate the function signature
- Narration openers ("// This function handles authentication.")
- References to the current task ("// Added for issue #123" — rots)
- Chain-of-thought ("// We chose Map because…")
- Multi-paragraph explanations — if needed, they belong in the PR or a doc

When you DO write one, one line. Two lines max.

# Subsystems map (proart)

For anything touching the desktop, look here before guessing:

- **NixOS config** — `~/nixos/` (flake). System + home-manager.
- **Dotfiles** — `~/nixos/dotfiles/` (stow-style layout, but home-manager does the
  symlinking, not stow; an in-repo subtree of nixos-config, not a standalone repo).
  See `~/nixos/dotfiles/SYSTEM.md` for the full architecture overview.
- **Quickshell (bar / pickers / notifications)** — `~/nixos/dotfiles/quickshell/.config/quickshell/`.
  Singletons in `modules/*State.qml`, pickers in `modules/*Picker.qml`, bar in `Bar.qml`.
- **Theme system** — `~/nixos/dotfiles/themes/.config/themes/`. `colors.json` → templates →
  `generated/<tool>/<mode>.theme` → `theme-manager.sh apply`.
- **Niri config + scripts** — `~/nixos/dotfiles/niri/.config/niri/`. Workspace stack scripts
  in `scripts/ws-*`. Window-jumping in `niri-jump-or-exec`.
- **palette-daemon** (cmd-palette overlay, source) — `~/personal/palette-daemon/`.
- **wpm-daemon** (bar WPM counter, source) — `~/personal/wpm-daemon/`.
- **Charybdis firmware fork** — `~/work/bastardkb-qmk/keyboards/bastardkb/charybdis/3x6/keymaps/daphen/`.

# Memory routing

I maintain a personal notes vault at `~/personal/notes/storage/`. The
canonical model is **local-file-first**: notes live as markdown files in
the vault; a push-only watcher (`notes-cli -watch`, a systemd user
service) auto-syncs file changes UP to the backend (Neon via `/api/sync`),
where the `notes-memory` MCP indexes them for semantic search. Backend →
local is the rare direction, pulled on demand.

## Saving — write a FILE when the vault exists; MCP only as fallback

The MCP `save_memory`/`save_note`/`add_todo` tools write straight to the
backend and SKIP the local file — that makes phantom notes: searchable but
never in the vault, and they don't come down on their own. So:

- **When `~/personal/notes/storage/` exists locally** (proart, any machine
  with the vault): save by writing a markdown file into the right subdir —
  `inbox/` (quick notes), `journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (daily + todos),
  `plans/`, `references/`, `meetings/`, `memory/` (memories, with
  `name`/`description`/`metadata.type` frontmatter). The watcher syncs it
  up. Do NOT call the MCP `save_*` tools here.
- **When the vault dir is absent** (lovbox SSH sandboxes, the Lovable
  agent, mobile): use the MCP `save_*` tools — the backend is the only
  reachable store there.

## Recalling — pull-then-search

When the user asks to recall/find a memory or note and the vault exists
locally, **run `notes-cli -pull` first**, then search/read the vault
(`rg`/Read over `~/personal/notes/storage/`). The pull syncs down anything
written elsewhere (a lovbox, mobile) so recall sees the full picture; it's
authenticated, idempotent (path-keyed upserts, server mtime preserved),
and cheap, so a no-op pull when nothing changed is harmless. Where the
vault is absent, recall via `notes-memory.search_notes(query)` instead.

When the user mentions ongoing projects (design system work, the notes
webapp, dotfiles), proactively pull-then-search for relevant context
before answering — the auto-loaded memory holds only a few profile facts;
the bulk lives in the vault.

The filesystem auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/-home-daphen/memory/` is
deprecated — the vault is canonical.

# Output style — always apply (ADHD)

Shape EVERY response for an ADHD reader, on every turn, without being asked —
coding, debugging, explanations, casual chat alike. This is not optional and
does not require invoking a skill: apply it by default.

HARD RULES (checkable, not vibes):
- **Default budget: ≤6 lines.** A routine answer, status, or confirmation fits
  in six lines or fewer. Exceeding the budget requires one of: David asked for
  detail, the content is a deliverable (plan, review, post-mortem), or a
  decision needs the context to be decidable.
- **Line 1 = the answer or the next action.** Never preamble, never a recap of
  the question.
- **Long content = 1-line TL;DR first**, then compressed numbered sections.
- **No done-recaps.** After completing work: one line — what changed + where.
  No "here's everything we did" paragraphs unless asked.
- **Max one offer/follow-up line** at the end, only if genuinely
  decision-relevant. No menus of things you could also do.
- Number multi-step work; one action per line.
- Externalize state across turns — restate what's done / pending; nothing
  off-screen survives.
- Recommendation, not a survey. Tangents die in the thinking, not the reply.
- Concrete numbers over vague ("~20s", not "briefly").

Violating the budget with justified content is fine; violating it with
narration is a defect. When in doubt, cut.

The `i-have-adhd` skill holds the full rationale; this directive makes its
shaping the standing default rather than an on-demand invocation.
