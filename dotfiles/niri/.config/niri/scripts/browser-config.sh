#
# Profiles run as separate processes via --user-data-dir so Chromium's
# "first-launch wins" --class quirk doesn't apply: each profile has
# its own master process and gets its own --class correctly. Side
# benefits: theme/extension restarts only affect one profile, force-
# quitting work doesn't kill personal, etc.
#
# Tested switches: Vivaldi ↔ Helium (both Chromium-based, identical
# CLI). Brave/Chrome/Edge would also work. Firefox needs different
# launcher logic (no --class, profile flag is -P) so this config
# isn't enough for that switch.
